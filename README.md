## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager
*   A Cloudflare account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cognicanvas.git
    cd cognicanvas
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

### Environment Variables

To run the application locally, you need to set up your environment variables for the Cloudflare Worker.

1.  Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project:
    ```sh
    touch .dev.vars
    ```

2.  Add the following required variables to your `.dev.vars` file. These are necessary to connect to the Cloudflare AI Gateway.

    ```ini
    CF_AI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_NAME/openai"
    CF_AI_API_KEY="YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY"
    ```

    *   Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID`, `YOUR_GATEWAY_NAME`, and `YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` with your actual Cloudflare credentials.

> **Note**: AI features will not work without valid Cloudflare AI Gateway credentials.

## üíª Development

To start the local development server, which includes the Vite frontend and the local Wrangler server for the worker, run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port). The frontend will automatically reload when you make changes to the `src` directory.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is designed for easy deployment to Cloudflare's global network.

1.  **Login to Cloudflare:**
    If you haven't already, authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account:
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script to build the application and deploy it to Cloudflare Pages and Workers.
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

3.  **Configure Production Secrets:**
    After deploying for the first time, you must add your AI Gateway credentials as secrets to your production worker.
    ```sh
    # For CF_AI_API_KEY
    bunx wrangler secret put CF_AI_API_KEY

    # For CF_AI_BASE_URL
    bunx wrangler secret put CF_AI_BASE_URL
    ```
    Follow the prompts to securely add your secrets. Your deployed application will not function correctly until these secrets are set.

Alternatively, deploy directly from your GitHub repository:
